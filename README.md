Welcome to LTS-5000, this is an API designed to help you write better and more consistent code.
It works by playing any loud noise whenever a build fails, an application throws an error or you have merge conflicts on your lateste pull request.


How to use it:

    There are multiple ways you can use this api.
    I recommend running it on a raspberry pi with bluetooth speakers connected for the server.


Actual examples to come in the future
